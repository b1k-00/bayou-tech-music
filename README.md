# Bayou Tech Solutions


## What is this?

This is a solution setup to view music using the .Net framework.

Some things to note:
 - This project is designed with [Clean Architecture](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/clean-architecture-with-net-62/).
 - The sample code in this project is made to be used as an example and then thrown away.
 - I am looking to configure the application with Azure
 - Amazon Cognito is stubbed out as the authentication provider, but is not fully implemented.

## Additional Considerations

This is not a full fledged solution. Here is just a smattering of things to havefor my portfolio and implement as part of my project work:
- Adding functionality to seed data
- Determine any external functionality for infratructure project
- Add middleware for exception handling
- Figure out unit testing of mediator
- Create and use app settings file for different environments
